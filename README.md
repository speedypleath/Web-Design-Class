# Web Design
This project was completed by June 2019 for my Web Design class

This was my first attempt at making a website, so it's pretty bad ngl


## How to run
npm install

node server.js

#### Address: http://localhost:8080

## Features
  * Very poorly implemented auth system (passwords are stored in plain text in a JSON file sorry)
  * Info about artists stored in JSON files
  * Admins can add artists
  * Admins can add albums and associate them with existing artists
  * Admins can add songs and associate them with existing albums
  * Users can click on an album. This will display a panel containing songs on said album. If the user clicks on any of the songs, the embedded player will play that song
